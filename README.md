# Swift6ArchitectureDemo
This shows off Swift 6 Architecture with MVVM PECANED 

[Here are the accompanying sldies](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y0OXOyQxuc75wuK0aj1kxRH3j9sIAn9syX9EK3EEmEk/edit?usp=sharing)

If you would like to see a version that does not use SwiftData, check out the branch [NoSwiftDataApproach](https://github.com/jonathangoldsmith/Swift6ArchitectureDemo/blob/NoSwiftDataApproach). It isn't cleaned up, but it removes the `@Query` needed in the `PostsListView` to populate the View, and uses a local storage alternative instead.
